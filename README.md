# pixel-level-dt-torch
Torch implementation of "[Pixel-Level Domain Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07442)"

## Note (important):
+ I found too many bugs in the [original repo](https://github.com/fxia22/PixelDTGAN), and the code was not running.
+ Finally, I decided to release __bug-fixed__ version of "[Pixel-Level Domain Transfer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07442)" with enhanced features.
+ The majority of the codes were brought from [original repo](https://github.com/fxia22/PixelDTGAN).

## What is different from original repo?
+ Most importantly, BUG FIXED.
+ The input size has been changed from 64 x 64 to 128 x 128.
+ Network structure was slightly modified.

## Prerequisites
